## Background

The dive log is the a SCUBA diver's bible. They bring it wherever they go, and treat it like a precious object, holder of all dives past. Nevertheless, the dive log has a tendency to get lost, wet, or forgotten at home. We built this app as a digital alternative to the dive log booklet, one that will be with you as long as you have an internet connection.
